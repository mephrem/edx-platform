    Management command to manually link ProgramEnrollments without an LMS user to an LMS user by username

    Usage:
        ./manage.py lms link_program_enrollments <program_uuid> <user_item>*
        where a <user_item> is a string formatted as <external_user_key>:<lms_username>

    Normally, program enrollments should be linked by the Django Social Auth post_save signal handler
    `lms.djangoapps.program_enrollments.signals.matriculate_learner`, but in the case that a partner does not
    have an IDP set up for learners to log in through, we need a way to link enrollments

    Provided a program uuid and a list of external_user_key:lms_username, this command will look up the matching
    program enrollments and users, and update the program enrollments with the matching user. If the program
    enrollment has course enrollments, we will enroll the user into their waiting program courses.

    If an external user key is specified twice, an exception will be raised and no enrollments will be modified.

    For each external_user_key:lms_username, if:
        - The user is not found
        - No enrollment is found for the given program and external_user_key
        - The enrollment already has a user
    An error message will be logged and the input will be skipped. All other inputs will be processed and
    enrollments updated.

    If there is an error while enrolling a user in a waiting program course enrollment, the error will be
    logged, and we will roll back all transactions for that user so that their db state will be the same as
    it was before this command was run. This is to allow the re-running of the same command again to correctly enroll
    the user once the issue preventing the enrollment has been resolved.

    No other users will be affected, they will be processed normally.
